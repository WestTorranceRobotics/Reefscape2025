# Dependencies
For the 2025 FRC Season we use some libraries (dependencies) that will need to be installed before you start developing! The following instructions should not need to be ran, but if you get errors like not being able to find `TalonSRX` then you should probably try this.

You can install these by entering the command pallete (by control + shift + p) then finding the `WPILib: Manage Vendor Libraries` option.
Once selecting then pressing enter, you will want to look for and press the `Install new libraries (online)`.

Copy and paste one of links below into the URL prompt that should appear. Rinse and repeat for all the remaining links that you have not done this for.
